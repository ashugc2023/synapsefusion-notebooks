  "title": "LangGraph for Beginners – Build Agentic Workflows Step-by-Step",
  "description": "A hands-on, beginner-friendly introduction to LangGraph – the powerful framework for creating stateful, multi-actor AI agents with cycles and branching logic. Learn how to build simple to advanced agent workflows (single agent, multi-agent, hierarchical) using visual nodes, state management, persistence, and human-in-the-loop patterns. Every lesson includes clear explanations, micro-exercises, ready-to-run Jupyter notebooks, and small projects.",
  "target_audience": "Beginners who know basic Python and want to build reliable, controllable AI agents that can plan, remember state, and loop until a task is complete.",
  "learning_objectives": [
    "Understand graphs vs chains and when to use LangGraph",
    "Create nodes, edges, and state schemas",
    "Build single-agent, multi-agent, and supervisor workflows",
    "Add memory, persistence, and human-in-the-loop",
    "Debug and visualize LangGraph executions",
    "Deploy a complete LangGraph agent as a web API"
  ],
